## How it works

This example uses the [Alt](http://alt.js.org) implementation of Flux to handle state.
The main `index.android.js` file wraps the entire app inside the Drawer & Navigator components.

Each "scene" is located within `./src/scenes`, with the Toolbar being global within `./src/components`.
To help improve performance, the scenes are loaded as and when they are needed.
